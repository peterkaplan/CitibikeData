## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

First, we load all of the necessary libaries and load the dataset.
```{r}


library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("lubridate")
library("geosphere")
library("ggmap")
```



Lets Read in the data
```{r}
citi <- read.csv("sample_data.csv")
head(citi)
```
